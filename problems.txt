five programming problems every software dev should solve

problem 1
write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in
a given list using a
-for-loop
-while-loop
-recursion
this is solved in sums.
- done as much as i can do

problem 2
- write a function that combines two lists by alternately taking
elements. For example given the two lists [a,b,c] and [1,2,3]
the function should return [1,b,2,c,3]
- yarp. i compressed too. which is a bit of a no no and not great code
 but see me here with no fucks to give.

problem 3
write a function that computes the list of the first fibonacci numbers
by definition the first two numbers in the f sequence are 0 and 1 and
each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
as an example, here are the first numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
-done but i fucking hate maths and this is everything i hate about maths

problem 4
write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges
them is such that they form the largest possible number
for example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest number is 95021
 - had to do a couple of conversions to get this to work
 squash it all out
 then do the comparison of indiviuals
 then squash it all back together
 this one was fun
 i could probably write this more elegantly but it worked


problem 5
write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing
 between the numbers 1, 2, ...9(in this order) such that the result is always 100
 for example 1 + 2 + 34 -5 + 67 -8 =9 = 100

 problem 6 Fizzbuzz
 write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
 but for multiples of 3 print fizz instead of the number and for the
 multiples of five print buzz. for numbers which are multiples of 5 and three
 print fizzbuzz.

 problem 7 coin flips
 how many different ways are there to flip a fair coin 5 times and not have three
 or more heads in a row? how about 10 to the 10 times and not have 534 or more heads in a row?

 8. question marks
 have a function take the str parameter, wich contains single digit numbers, nletters, adn ?
 check if there are exactly 3 question marks between every pair of 2 numbers that add up to 10
 if so, return tru
 othersiese fals
 if there arnt' any 2 numbers that add up to 10 in the string, return false

 input: aa6?9 - false
 acc?7??sss?3rr1??????5 - true
 aarb6???4xxbl5???eee5 - true : there are 3 question marks beteen 6 and 4 and 3 question
 marks between 5 and 5

 9. vowel square
 have a fucntion take  a parameter passed with is a 2d matrix of arbitrary size filled with
 the letters from the alphabet, and determine if a 2*2 square composed entirely of vowels
 exists in in the matrix. ex
 abcd
 eikr
 oufj

 has ei ou
 program needs to return the top left position, 1=-. if no square of vowels comes out
 return not found. if multiple squares of vowedl return the one that is most top left of the matric
 input matrix must be at least 2 by 2

 eg input ['aqrst', 'ukeai', ffooo]
 output '1-2'

 ['gg', 'ff'] outptu is not found
 10. scale balancing

 11. correct path

 12. closest enemy
