five programming problems every software dev should solve

problem 1
write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in
a given list using a
-for-loop
-while-loop
-recursion
this is solved in sums.

problem 2
write a function that combines two lists by alternately taking
elements. For example given the two lists [a,b,c] and [1,2,3]
the function should return [1,b,2,c,3]

problem 3
write a function that computes the list of the first fibonacci numbers
by definition the first two numbers in the f sequence are 0 and 1 and
each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two
as an example, here are the first numbers:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

problem 4
write a function that given a list of non negative integers, arranges
them is such that they form the largest possible number
for example, given [50, 2, 1, 9], the largest number is 95021
 - use a lexical comparison of strings


problem 5
write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing
 between the numbers 1, 2, ...9(in this order) such that the result is always 100
 for example 1 + 2 + 34 -5 + 67 -8 =9 = 100
